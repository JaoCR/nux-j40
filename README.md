# nux-j40
My centralized linux configs, made for arcolinux on qtile

## Instalation (how I like to do, if I forget)
* install arcolinuxd only with your choice of kernels, configure you keyboard and login stuff too.
* clone this repo as ~/.j40
* enter the directory, read, modify as needed, and run the setup.sh script
* reboot and login
